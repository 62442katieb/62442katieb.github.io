			<h2>My research philosophy</h2>
		</header>
		<p>There are three interlocking components that support my research and study of individual brain network variability: collaborations both inside and outside my home institution, including big-group collaborative efforts; co-working at hackathons, where many of these collaborations and projects were born; and developing open tools and resources to support and increase accessibility to rigorous, open, and reproducible science.

					<h3>Impacts of ambient air pollutants on brain microstructure and functional connectome development</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Ambient air pollution comprises chemicals with documented neurotoxic effects and it poses a particular risk to child neurodevelopment and mental health, which can have lifespan consequences. This project seeks to identify impacts of various sources of air pollution on child structural and functional brain development durting the transition to adolescence, using multivariate cross-decomposition, predictive connectomics, and mixture modeling.<br>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dylu?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Jacek Dylag</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mmar_Xs8_mk?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>

					<h3>Heterogeneity in child and adolescent brain development</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As trajectories in structural brain development are being identified, heterogeneity in these trajectories due to individual differences in development, maturation, and cognition is often overlooked. Uncovering sources and magnitudes of variability in brain development would contribute to our understanding of development and the limitations of cross-sectional research in studying it.<br>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@fakurian?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Milad Fakurian</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/58Z17lnVS4U?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>

					<h3>Individual differences in brain function during physics education</h3>
				</header>
				<p>University instruction in physics represents a unique experience for many individuals and STEM education best practices are increasingly important. Introductory physics courses are a gateway top many STEM majors and, thus, a pivotal node in the "leaky pipeline" leading to gender gap in STEM careers and higher education. This project assesses factors contributing to student success in introductory physics and the roles of pedagogy, gender, and behavior therein.<br>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/ja/@sunder_2k25?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Sunder Muthukumaran</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/d7SxBxEAOfU?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>

					<h3>Tools for rigorous neuroimaging meta-analysis</h3>
				</header>
				<p>One approach to addressing the neuroimaging replication crisis and making quantitative sense of the overabundance of underpowered neuroimaging studies is meta-analysis. In addition to finding consensus across published studies, meta-analytic methods can uncover latent patterns across the literature and provide useful resources for primary data analysis.

					<h3>Brain connectivity of subcortical regions at 7T</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During my undergraduate and early doctoral studies, I worked on a series of projects using functional connectivity, probabilistic tractography, and meta-analytic connectivity mapping to study the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and habenula.
