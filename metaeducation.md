    <p><em>Educational course lecture at the 29th annual meeting of the Organization for Human Brian Mapping in July 2023 â€¢ Montreal, British Columbia Canada</em></p>
    <p>
    Gave a lecture on conventional (i.e., manual) and automated approaches to neuroimaging meta-analyses, including use cases, pros/cons, and examples of each. This lecture provided information, resources, and recommendations for researchers looking to use meta-analytic methods to assess convergence and/or discrepancies across the neuroimaging literature.

<h2>Data Mining in the Era of Big Data: The BrainMap Database as a Resource for Characterizing Brain Networks in Psychiatric Illness</h2>
<p>Chapter in <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-59797-9">Brain Network Dysfunction in Neuropsychiatric Illness</a></em></p>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/textcover.webp %}" alt="" /></span>Neuroimaging meta-analysis provides an exciting opportunity to evaluate consensus and generate new hypotheses using data mined from the published literature. This chapter provides a review of meta-analysis techniques available via the BrainMap Project, including activation likelihood estimation (ALE), independent component analysis (ICA), and clustering. Prior work emphasizing clinical utility of these meta-analytic methods are discussed.
