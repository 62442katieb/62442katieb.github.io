I am on the job market! Currently, I'm interested in tenure-track Assistant Professor positions in neuroscience, public health, and child development, as well as non-academic positions geared towards either (a) increasing access to scientific tools and knowledge or (b) developing and applying machine-learning tools for methodologically-robust, data-driven analytics.
