			<h2>About Me</h2>
		</header>
		<p><span class="image left-rounded"><img src="{% link assets/images/profpic2021.jpeg %}" alt="" /></span>Hello! My name is Katie Bottenhorn and I am a developmental cognitive neuroscientist interested in developing, applying, and sharing cutting-edge tools for robust analysis of individual variability in child and adolescent brain development. Conceptually, my current research focuses on roles of puberty and air pollution exposure in within- and between-individual differences in functional and microstructural neurodevelopment.
		</p>
    <p><span class="image right-rounded"><img src="{% link assets/images/fred.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>Throughout this site, I have included information on my <a href="connectivity.html">current and past research projects</a>, my portfolio of <a href="scicomm.html">scientific outreach and education</a>, and <a href="tools.html">research tools</a> that I am developing or have contributed to, as well as a fairly up-to-date listing of <a href="publications.html">peer-reviewed manuscripts and (not peer-reviewed) preprints</a> that I have written or to which I have conitributed.</p>
    <p>Outside of the wonderful world of science, most of my time is spent reading (fiction! for fun!!), hiking with my dog, and cooking. I rescued Fred (right) a few years ago and my PhD in Psychology has come in very handy in my amateur dog training efforts (<i>N</i>=1).</p>
