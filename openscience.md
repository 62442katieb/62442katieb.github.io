<h2>Cultivating Open Science Practices in Academic Research and Culture</h2>
  <div class="6u 12u$(small)">
    <p><em>Educational Course at the 28th annual meeting of the Organization for Human Brian Mapping in June 2022 • Glasgow, Scotland, UK</em></p>
    <p>
    Organized a half-day course comprising 6 lectures and a panel discussion, together with Stephanie Noble and Naomi Gaggi, focusing on integrating open science practices into existing research workflows at multiple levels of technical expertise and career stage.

    Many researchers agree with the general premise of open science but are unsure where to start, with the deluge of tools, services, and skills associated with open science. This issue is compounded by perceptions of the broader open science community, in part based on comments made by open science advocates. Some expect an “all-or-nothing” approach, suggesting that researchers must be open in all aspects in order for their science to be open. Others see an exclusionary culture, based on high technical skill requirements or consisting of a culturally homogeneous group of individuals to which they do not belong. We aimed to dissuade these notions by lowering the barrier to entry to belonging in open science and providing researchers with tools to make their own spaces more scientifically and culturally open.

<h2>Addressing Inclusivity in Open Science</h2>
<p><em>Talk given wtih Melvin Selim Atay in an oral session Addressing the Social Limitations in Open Science at the Organization for Human Brain Mapping's annual meeting in 2021</em></p>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/inclusivity.png %}" alt="" /></span>The goals of open science are, broadly, to democratize access and to promote good research practices. Unfortunately, these goals fall short in several key ways, at the center of which are equity, diversity, and inclusivity (EDI) not only of the community, but of the fruits of their labors. Historically, the open science movement has been dominated by a narrow demographic with the access and support (institutional and otherwise) to time and resources they can spend on “open science” efforts. This monolithic culture has been furthered by (1) a gravitation of open science efforts on technical solutions and valuation of technical skills and (2) a reliance on computational resources that are inaccessible to a large proportion of the globe. While the community has become more diverse in the past few years, there is still a long way to go and the products of open science remain sequestered in the global North. Furthermore, EDI disparities have been highlighted by continuing socio-economic issues, recent increases in related scholarship, and the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing that our science isn’t as open as it should be. From culture to reachability, accessibility, there remains a lot of room for improvement. Failure in achieving EDI goals, not only hinders science, but imposes clear limitations and biases in the voices around us and the knowledge we produce. Science benefits from diversity in perspectives, experiences, and beliefs, in addition to accessible tools and reproducible research practices. New ways of thinking, understanding and learning are needed, new ways of establishing inclusion as a culture is needed to encourage and include historically underrepresented people, without such practices open science would not be as open as it should be.<br><br><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4787551" class="button small">Slides</a>

<h2>Reproducible (brain) data visualization in Python</h2>
  <p><em>Tutorials given at the ABCD-ReproNim virtual course in 2021 & 2022, and at Florida International Univeristy's Cognitive Neuroscience Program seminar series in 2020 and Summer Bootcamp in 2019</em></p>
  <p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/abcdrepronim-dataviz.png %}" alt="" /></span>Lead interactive tutorials on Python tools for domain-general data visualization (i.e., Matplotlib, Seaborn) and for functional neuroimaging data visualization (i.e., Nilearn), based on a <a href="https://github.com/KirstieJane/NH19-Visualization"> Kirstie Whitaker's data visualization tutorial given at NeuroHackademy in 2019</a>. Topics included basic plotting with Matplotlib, manipulating basic plots and figure objects, displaying statistical results in plots, dataframe manipulation, and several options for making both static and interactive brain plots in both volume and surface spaces using Nilearn.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/62442katieb/Data-Visualization" class="button small">GitHub Repository</a>
